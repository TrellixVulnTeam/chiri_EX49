## Cornershop S3 NPM

This package is used to release internal packages to our private NPM registry hosted on S3.

### Using the Cornershop NPM registry

```bash
curl -s -L https://npm.cornershop.io/activate | bash
```

This script will set up the AWS credentials that you already have in your machine and will create an `.npmrc` file in your root folder setting the npm registry for scoped packages. This means that every time you try to install a npm package with the scope `@cornershop`, yarn or npm will look for that package in our internal registry instead of the public npm registry.

> Even though we set the `.npmrc` file, you can install packages using npm or yarn.

If you want to release packages to our internal registry, please contact #infrastructure to set up CI.

### Releasing a new version of this package to Cornershop NPM

* Bump version in package.json, for example 1.0.1
* Create a git tag with exactly the same name as the version, for example 1.0.1
* CircleCI will build and upload the new package version
* If the version from package.json already exists in NPM, you will get an error
